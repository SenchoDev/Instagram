## About App

I took my skills to another level where i decided to re-create instagram app and its main functionalites. Its was very challenging but the grind paid off. 
App was built with React(Context API & React Hooks), GraphQl & Apollo, Cloudinary, Hasura with PostgreSQl DB, Firebase Auth, Material UI and over 10+ other libraries.
